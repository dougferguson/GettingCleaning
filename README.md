# Getting and Cleaning Data

<b>Coursera assignment for the course that I am auditing (no certificate)</b>
<br><br>

In this project I sought to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.

Appropriately label the dataset with descriptive variable names. 

Create a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
