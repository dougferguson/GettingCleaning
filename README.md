# Getting and Cleaning Data
Coursera assignment

In this project I sought to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.

Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 

Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
